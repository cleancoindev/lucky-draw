It's an NFT based lucky draw where, the last NFT standing wins the game after draws.

The buyer mints NFTs with a unique ticket number by purchasing ticket from the pool. A random ticket is drawn at a fixed time interval and, eliminate the number from the game. With each draw the probability of winning increases. The last standing ticket wins. This game has interesting dynamics in secondary markets which will follow the principles of “Game Theory”.

On each pool creation, a smart contract gets deployed on the Matic Network. The smart contract is written in Solidity and the Frontend is written in React.js. This project uses IPFS to store the NFT image.
